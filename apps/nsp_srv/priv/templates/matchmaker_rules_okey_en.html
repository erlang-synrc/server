                    Indicator tile that will be placed in the highlighted zone. A player who has that
                    same tile, can double click it to earn the dedicated points. This must be done
                    before the first tile has been drawn, and not after.

                    (There are 2 fake joker tiles to replace these tiles that will be used as joker tiles).

                    Tile 1 can be used after tile 13 when using consecutive numbers.
                    It is necessary that all 14 tiles are used in sets when opening a hand. 
                    Possible set variations can be in groups of 4-4-3-3 or 5-3-3-3 or 5-5-4 which all make 14. 
                    There must not be any gaps between the consecutive numbers (3-4-6 is not acceptable).

                    7 doubles can also open a hand. These doubles must be made of a 
                    set of two tiles that have the same color and number. ( 7-7 both 
                    red or 4-4 both green etc...) This is called going double. It is required to arrange 
                    the tiles 2 by 2 with a gap in between them. When the 15th tile is drawn and 
                    placed upon the pile, you can declare that you have completed the hand.

                    in-game bonus points are collected. The game points are collected within the        
                    pot during the game including the indicator point. When a player throws a joker,        
                    goes double, do an eighter or a color hand, in addition to those points, the player        
                    gets the points in the pot. When the pot is emptied, the system adds the game point before a new hand is        
                    started so the pot never stays empty.
